# Cicada Privacy Pledge (Draft)

## What is this?

You're reading the first draft of the Cicada Privacy Pledge. Nothing is set in stone right now, even the name is not final however I want to start somewhere.

## Why?

Laws like the GDPR exists, but why do the legal minimum? No matter what a law say we are allowed to do, we need to protect our users privacy. This is a sort of alternative, more strict version of this which you can implement without any affiliation to some countries legal system.

## Who is this for?

First and foremost activists and independent developers. To create a profitable product while following these might be hard but is something you can still strive for. 

## Background

Cicada 3301 is/was an anonymous organization that created a huge puzzle competition. I want to keep their spirit of creating privacy and security conscious software alive but this time in an open, inclusive environment. This document is just the first part of a larger project to create better, more free software.

1. Privacy by default

Privacy should never be opt-in. This is the most important part of this pledge. Having sane defaults is the only way to compete with the likes of Facebook.

Software needs to be easy.

1. Anonymous by default

Don't require account creation to view information (I'm looking at you, Quora & Reddit).

Accounts need to be pseudonymous by default and data can only be connected when it is actually needed.

# 1. No third-party and personalized Tracking
  While it can be hard to accomplish for existing apps, third party tracking is never required.
  Never use personalized tracking.

# 2. Minimize third-party dependencies
  This includes ...

# 3. Minimize trust
  Don't use external services providers that you don't need to use for a good user experience.

# 4. Don't block visitors based on Country/VPN/Tor
# 5. Everything is open source or source available
# 6. Prevent Conflicts of interest
  If there's the possibility of a conflict of interest between you and your users - think again.<br>
  This might happen with ads: There are ethical ways to do sponsorships and advertisements, but often, advertisements harm the privacy of your users and have the possibility to harm your integrity. Before integrating a service think twice if it will harm your users' privacy. <br>
  Another common occurrence of this are so-called dark UX patterns: Tricks that are used to trick users into doing something they didn't intend to do.
